# 🔑 API Keys Setup - Quick Action Guide

## 🎯 YOU'RE HERE: OpenAI API Key Configuration

Your OneLastAI project is almost ready! You just need to add your actual API keys to make the AI features work.

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. Get Your OpenAI API Key (REQUIRED)
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in to your OpenAI account (create one if needed)
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (it starts with `sk-`)
5. Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` in your `.env` file

### 2. Get Your HuggingFace Token (REQUIRED for AI models)
1. Go to: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Sign in to your HuggingFace account (create one if needed)
3. Click "New token" with "Read" access
4. Copy the token (it starts with `hf_`)
5. Replace `YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN_HERE` in your `.env` file

## 📁 Files Updated
- ✅ `.env` - Your environment configuration (edit this!)
- ✅ `config/credentials_temp.yml` - Template with guidance
- ✅ `CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Detailed instructions

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### After adding your API keys:
```powershell
# Start database services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Start the Rails server
rails server

# Or use the development helper
bin/dev
```

## 🔍 Current File Structure
Your `.env` file is located at:
```
c:\Users\HP\fluffy-space-garbanzo\.env
```

Look for these lines and replace the placeholder values:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE    # ← Replace this
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN_HERE  # ← Replace this
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
- OpenAI keys start with `sk-`
- HuggingFace tokens start with `hf_`
- Keep your keys secure and never commit them to Git
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` to protect your keys

## 🆘 Need Help?
- **OpenAI API Issues**: Check your billing and usage limits
- **HuggingFace Access**: Ensure you have a free account
- **Rails Server Issues**: Make sure Docker services are running first

## 🎯 Next Step
1. Open your `.env` file
2. Add your OpenAI API key
3. Add your HuggingFace token
4. Save the file
5. Run `rails server`

Your OneLastAI project will be fully functional once these keys are added! 🚀
