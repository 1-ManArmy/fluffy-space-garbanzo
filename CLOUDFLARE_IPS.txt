# CLOUDFLARE IP RANGES TO ADD TO AWS SECURITY GROUP
# Add these as INBOUND RULES for HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443)

## IPv4 Ranges:
173.245.48.0/20
103.21.244.0/22
103.22.200.0/22
103.31.4.0/22
141.101.64.0/18
108.162.192.0/18
190.93.240.0/20
188.114.96.0/20
197.234.240.0/22
198.41.128.0/17
162.158.0.0/15
104.16.0.0/13
104.24.0.0/14
172.64.0.0/13
131.0.72.0/22

## MANUAL STEPS:
1. Go to AWS Console > EC2 > Security Groups
2. Find your instance's security group
3. Add INBOUND RULES:
   - Type: HTTP (80), Source: Custom, add each IP range above
   - Type: HTTPS (443), Source: Custom, add each IP range above

## ALTERNATIVE: Open to all (less secure but works)
- HTTP (80): 0.0.0.0/0
- HTTPS (443): 0.0.0.0/0
